At Affirm we are using technology to re-imagine and re-build core parts of financial infrastructure to enable friendlier and more transparent financial products and services that improve lives.

<br>
Machine Learning is a critical part of Adobe&rsquo;s Cloud offering. Adobe Clouds enable customers to create and manage digital content, such as assets, composites, 3D, documents etc., and digital experience and transformations.
<br>
Creative Cloud is focused on visual imagination and creation, and includes such well-known products as Photoshop CC, Illustrator CC, Lightroom CC, and Adobe Stock. Document Cloud is centered around the creation and management of textual documents, including Acrobat DC and Adobe Sign. Experience Cloud is the set of offerings for the large-scale enterprise, covering marketing, advertising, and analytics.
<br>
We are building new machine learning platform, called Adobe Sensei, that powers machine learning and AI across all of these Adobe Cloud product lines.

The objective is to make machine learning offerings a world-class, leading-edge, differentiating product in Adobe Cloud ecosystem. We match the pace, innovation and excitement of a startup, backed by the resources and infrastructure of Adobe!
<br>
A crucial piece of developing machine learning solutions is the evaluation process. How do we know the quality of our algorithms and models? What is the ground truth we use for judging them? Where do they succeed and how do they fail? These problems are even more subtle in the complex, creative domains of Adobe products &ndash; for example, how should we judge the quality of similarity search, where a user finds new images with an image as the query?
<br>
How can you participate? We&rsquo;re looking for data scientists to define, drive, and coordinate evaluation for the Applied Machine Learning team at Adobe. This will involve thinking hard about product quality, the role of machine learning in those products, and the capabilities of both A/B tests and human-judgment tasks to arrive at quantitative evaluations that measure how well our AI/ML algorithms are doing their jobs.

Responsibilities:
<br>
&bull; Work closely with product, research, and engineering leaders to understand ML applications and define success
<br>
&bull; Design evaluation tasks and guidelines for human judgment to measure the performance of machine-learned and other advanced algorithms.
<br>
&bull; Help design A/B tests for our cloud offerings, and use human judgment vs. end-user A/B tests as appropriate
<br>
&bull; Create a winning culture built on collaboration and shared accomplishments- have fun along the way!
<br>
Qualifications:
<br>
&bull; BS or MS in a technical field (Computer Science, Physics, Math, Statistics) OR in a huna-centered field such as Psychology, Linguistics, Human-Computer Interaction.
<br>
&bull; Exposure to applied machine learning in an industrial setting
<br>
&bull; Experience in validation and evaluation of machine learned models
<br>
&bull; Strong quantitative orientation
<br>
&bull; Understanding of issues around ground truth and training sets for ML, including human judgment and A/B testing
<br>
&bull; Hands-on experience using third-party judgment services such as Crowdflower, Appen, or Amazon Mechanical Turk

<br>
Kinsa has re-imagined the first device parents turn to during an illness - the thermometer - into a support system to keep the whole family healthy. Kinsa supports families from the first sign of illness through recovery and beyond by focusing on what’s most important in that moment - what to do next. The Kinsa system remembers health details for future reference, offers personalized guidance on how to soothe symptoms, take medications and call the doctor, and allows for instant access to relevant services (e.g., telemedicine, sick child care services) right when they’ll be most helpful. We’ve been humbled by powerful stories about how Kinsa has helped users get their sick children the right care they need - for example, one mother believes Kinsa saved her child’s life and another says Kinsa has helped give her 5 year old son with autism a voice . <br>
<br>
Kinsa is FDA-cleared and pediatrician recommended, has won 8 national parenting awards, and appeared in an Apple's "Parenthood" TV commercial. Kinsa was founded by Inder Singh, a software engineer turned health executive who has dedicated his life to improving the health of children. Before starting Kinsa, Inder worked for former President Bill Clinton and brokered the deals that lowered the price of medicines for infectious illnesses, saving over $1 billion and enabling tens of millions of children to receive life-saving treatment. Kinsa is backed by Kleiner Perkins, the earliest investor in Amazon and Google, and others.</span><br><div id="p_c40e02cb4095f284">

<li>Create real-world, risk-based models to project cyber loss and prioritize cyber risk remediation based on historical data.</li>
<li>Work with our security team to address factors not captured by an expected loss model such as serious new vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Identify aggregation risks and interventions that could minimize them.</li>
<li>Investigate new data sources and work with our back-end engineers to improve data collection and to turn your modeling into production-grade code.</li>
<li>Leverage the large and sparse data sets we collect on technical infrastructure to improve our risk modeling.</li>

<li>Experience across the spectrum of decision-making and (business) analytics, with demonstrated ability to utilize the appropriate statistical tools to solve a given data analysis problem.</li>
<li>Eager to work with messy, real-world datasets from many disparate sources (expect to interface with high-dimensional, sparse data).</li>
<li>Know how to operate in a modern data science stack - you will have strong SQL skills, experience with data wrangling and script writing, and have familiarity with Python data science tooling.</li>
<li>See data science as a powerful tool to get things done rather than as an end in itself.</li>
<li>Passionate about breaking down and understanding complex systems and taking ownership of solving them in a fast-paced and self-starter environment.</li>
<li>Eager to learn and apply new techniques to a unique data set.</li>
</ul>

<span id="job_summary" class="summary">WHO WE ARE
<br><br>
Bold Metrics Inc. (BMI) has created a suite of AI technologies that allows brands to accurately predict customer body measurements and relate them to garment specifications. Using our cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, retailers and brands are ditching conventional sizing solutions and leveraging our technology to reduce returns and increase conversions. Ultimately, our goal is to revolutionize the apparel industry by leveraging this data to unlock body-relative apparel design.
<br><br>
Historically, apparel sizes have been generated in the absence of customer-driven body data. This has lead to a worldwide apparel waste problem caused by a high rate of returns coupled with a bad consumer experience around fit and sizing, often amplified online. Along with garment sizing optimizations, the downstream experience becomes more customer-driven, leading to a significant reduction in returns and happier customers.
<br><br>
We are a venture-backed well funded company ($3.77M raised to-date) with year-over-year growth of 350%. Bold Metrics works with some of the world’s largest brands, retailers and clothing manufacturers in the US, Europe and Asia, and has offices in Austin, TX and San Francisco, CA.

Do you love writing for a general audience, and want to share your research findings with media and the public?</p><p>
Glassdoor has an opening for an <b>Economist / Data Scientist</b> within our growing Economic Research group. The position will work directly with our Chief Economist and decision science team, and will be a highly visible role on our research group at glassdoor.com/research (our company&rsquo;s think tank).</p><p>
You will help maintain our Python and R models, develop and publish insights and commentary about trends in the labor market, and be a spokesperson for Glassdoor.

We&rsquo;re looking for an economist / data scientist who can be a superstar in three basic areas:</p><ul><li><b>
Maintain our Python and R Models:</b> Manage the SQL, Python and R code for our team&rsquo;s models behind our data products (including the Glassdoor &ldquo;Local Pay Reports&rdquo;).

Write Research Reports:</b> You will help brainstorm creative research ideas for short reports, blog posts, and data visualizations using Glassdoor&rsquo;s salary, company ratings and job openings data, as well as official BLS and other third-party data.

Unlike most economists, it is essential that you are able to write clearly for a lay audience. Be ready to share your best sole-authored writing samples with us. Writing and speaking is a critical skill for this role.</li><li>

Knowledge of standard data science and &ldquo;big data&rdquo; tools such as predictive machine learning methods, regression trees, random forest models, lasso methods, etc. is a plus but not required. Our research can be as technical as you&rsquo;re willing to go&mdash;the sky is the limit in terms of professional development in this role.</li></ul><p><b>

Airtime is looking for a combined data scientist+engineer reporting to the head of data science who will own building and improving our real-time machine learning and recommendation systems.
<br><br>
About Airtime
<br><br>
Today, online means alone immersed in microblogs and success theater. We're changing that. We are charting the course for the next era of the Internet: live, shared experiences. We're building a new way to use the Internet together.
<br><br>
That’s why we’re pioneering a new kind of social experience, one designed for togetherness. At its core, Airtime is a social platform for doing whatever together. Gather with your people to explore the Internet: group video, listen to music, chat, watch stuff, send pictures, GIFs, and more.
<br><br>
Go watch the app marketing video on https://air.me/ ( https://air.me/ ) then check out the app in person.
<br><br>
Our company was founded a few years ago by Sean Parker and Shawn Fanning and is backed by Kleiner Perkins, Andreessen Horowitz, Google Ventures, Founders Fund, and a host of other amazing partners.
<br><br>
What You’ll Do
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Work alongside the product, engineering and data science teams to build scalable real-time machine learning and recommendation systems for friends to make, rooms to join, media to watch together, and contacts to invite to Airtime</li>
<li>Transform a stream of 100k user events per minute into real time recommendation updates for millions of users.</li>
<li>Work with the backend and data science team to build a system like Uber’s Michelangelo (https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo/ ( https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo/ )) that allows for efficient exploration of different algorithms and approaches.</li>
<li>Work with multiple data sources including Kinesis, SQS, Aurora, MongoDB</li>
</ul>
Who You Are
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Motivated to do and learn what is necessary to accomplish your goals: You’ll bring your existing experience to bear but you will need to learn about our product space, engineering environment, and novel ways to meaningfully improve the quality of our recommendation systems.</li>
<li>Excited by both data engineering and machine learning challenges. It will be necessary to feel comfortable with the entire data science pipeline and engineering environment. You’ll solve theoretical problems and write code at scale.</li>
<li>Comfortable with, and better yet excited by, product exploration. We are continually changing and improving our product to delight users.</li>
<li>Have a strong engineering and analytics mindset. You don’t need any particular degree just a provable track record of delivering.</li>
<li>Works well with a team. Not a cowgirl or cowboy. Teams that encourage and foster debate in a healthy way provably deliver the best work.</li>
</ul>
Our Team
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Focused on value add for the user. That means we leverage third-party libraries and tools where it makes sense, but have also been committed to building key technology in-house that sets Airtime apart. You can read more about it on our tech blog at https://techblog.airtime.com/ ( https://techblog.airtime.com/ ). In short we’ve built a nodejs microservice based messaging backend, globally distributed WebRTC based media stack, Android+iOS mobile clients, and desktop client.</li>
<li>Similarly, on the data science side we leverage Redshift, Looker, Segment, Mixpanel and whatever else that helps us achieve our goals faster</li>
<li>Minimizes meetings. We are a distributed team across NYC, SF, and PA but besides our weekly 30 minute sprint planning and company all hands we only have one-off meetings as necessary to discuss specific product or technical topics. We generally just coordinate on Airtime and on Slack.</li>
</ul>
What Happens Next?
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>If you like what you’ve seen and heard then apply!</li>
<li>After you apply we’ll reach out to discuss to make sure there is a good overall fit.</li>
<li>If there is a good overall fit, you’ll have some phone chats with our head of data science, VP of Engineering and VP of Product</li>
<li>If that goes well, we will ask you to complete an analysis and machine learning challenge ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/airchallenge/data-science/AirtimeDataScienceChallenge.html ) directly related to what you’ll be doing.</li>
<li>If that goes well you’ll come on site and talk to around four team members where you’ll go over a variety of data science and engineering topics</li>
<li>If everything goes well we will be back to you in a day or so with our answer and maybe an offer!</li>
